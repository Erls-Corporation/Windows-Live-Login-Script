Skydrive Login
=============

A two line Greasemonkey script to autofill username and password fields on Windows Live web pages.

Firefox never asks to remember the password for Skydrive, so this is a hack to force the fields to be filled. It should work for all Windows Live properties like hotmail.


Installation
------------
Download skydrive_login.user.js and edit the file with your own e-mail and password, replacing 'YOUR-EMAIL' and 'YOUR-PASSWORD'.
Then drag the file from your saved location onto the browser. If Greasemonkey in installed, it should detect and ask to install the script. Chrome will auto-detect and ask to install the script even without Greasemonkey. That's it.
